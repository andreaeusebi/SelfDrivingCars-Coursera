  Transform sensor readings to Cartesian coordinates in the sensor
  frame. The values of epsilon and alpha are given in radians, while

  azimuth angle (i.e., in the x,y plane).

def estimate_params(P):
  """
  Estimate parameters from sensor readings in the Cartesian frame.
  Each row in the P matrix contains a single 3D point measurement;
  the matrix P has size n x 3 (for n points). The format is:
  
  P = [[x1, y1, z1],
       [x2, x2, z2], ...]
       
  where all coordinate values are in metres. Three parameters are
  required to fit the plane, a, b, and c, according to the equation
  
  z = a + bx + cy
  
  The function should retrn the parameters as a NumPy array of size
  three, in the order [a, b, c].
